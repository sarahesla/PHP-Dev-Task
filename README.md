# PHP Dev Task

Hello!

My name is Sarah and I’m an applicant for the Junior PHP Full-Stack Developer position :)

I wanted to write this to introduce myself a bit, kind of like a cover letter, and quickly go over my solution for the dev task you sent me.

I’ve always been interested in programming– it started with my cousins teaching me binary and hex as a 10 year old and then me making ugly HTML websites with the help of W3 schools.

I was lucky enough to have computer science taught at my high school and so one of my favourite memories was building an entire webapp from scratch during my final semester with my best friends. Before that, we’d only ever written small standalone programs in C, but this time we had to teach ourselves everything from SQL to PHP!

That’s actually why I’m so excited about this position; it was a nice nostalgia trip to go back and write PHP code as that’s where my fullstack journey began.

As you’ll see on my resume, I also have a more formal post-secondary education in computer science which taught me about writing good, clean, and well-documented code.

I also tried to apply OOP principles like Encapsulation and SOLID principles like Single Responsibility. I wanted to avoid making my implementation too complicated, but in a larger project I would apply further SOLID principles to make the program extendable with minimal complications.

For example, if we wanted car’s to behave differently on different track element types, I would make a Track Interface for each track type to implement. This way, you could add new track types and pass them into Race without breaking the code. This would adhere to the Liskov Substitution principle, and depending on how you do it also the Open-Close and Dependency Inversion principles.

Anyways, I don’t want to make this too long but according to the job post, Katipult is looking for people who are unconventional, hard working and easy to work with. As somebody who started her own business from her bedroom to pay for school, I think I fit the bill and would love the opportunity to interview!
